Jesus on Hanukkah
======================================================================

I was fascinated the other night, when I was reading in John, to run
across this in John 10:22-23:

>   And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was
>   winter.  And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.

What got my attention was that I've read this passage dozens of times
and never noticed the bit about the "feast of the dedication."
