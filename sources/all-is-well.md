Two Versions of _All is Well_
======================================================================

This is not really for public consumption.  These are two versions of
a tune for the text "What's this that steals upon my frame," one from
the Southern Harmony and one from the American Vocalist.

 - [Southern Harmony version](/southern-harmony.mp3)
 - [American Vocalist version](/american-vocalist.mp3)

I recorded both on a tablet, I'm getting over a cold, and I can't sing
a lick to start with, so they'reâ€¦ probably not much fun to listen to.
