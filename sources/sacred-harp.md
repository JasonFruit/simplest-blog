Sacred Harp
======================================================================

I love going to Sacred Harp singings.  I don't get to go a lot these
days, what with young kids and a number of other things on my plate
that I think deserve more attention, but when I do, I have a wonderful
time.  Here's what goes on at a singing:

When you go to a singing, you step into a large room with benches or
chairs arranged into a square with an open area at the center — they
call it "the hollow square".  Each side of the square corresponds to a
voice part; basses are men, most altos are women, and the remaining
two parts, treble and tenor (or lead), are sung in octaves by men and
women.  Treble and tenor have about the same range, but tenor has the
melody.  You choose your part based on your voice range and personal
preference; my voice is a little high for bass, and a little low for
tenor, but I like the feel of the bass lines, so I sing bass.  You sit
where you choose; most beginners choose tenor.

Usually, your first time, you can borrow a book.  They're not all that
expensive, though, and if you have any taste at all, you'll probably
want one of your own.  The words are hymns, and many of the tunes are
recognizable variants of common hymn tunes, but the music is not
written like the hymnals you are likely to see in your average church,
to the extent that your average church uses hymnals at all these days.
Instead, they're written in open score, one voice part per staff,
across pages that are broader than they are tall.  Most
disconcertingly, the notes aren't round, either; their shape differs
based on what degree of the scale they are in the key of the tune in
question.  The major scale, then, looks like this, with the solfège
symbols used to sing it:

The familiar tune, Old Hundred, looks like the below.  Note that the
tune is in the third line, the tenor — this is from the 1911 edition,
but it's about the same now:

It sounds like this:

>    you get used to it.  In a major scale, the whole-steps between
>    degrees 1, 2, and 3 are sung to _fa, sol, la_; then there's a
>    half-step up to the next _fa_, which begins a whole-step _fa,
>    sol, la_ sequence where you'd usually expect it, on 4, 5, and 6.
>    Finally, there's another whole-step up to 7, which gets the
>    syllable _mi_.  Then the pattern starts over again for the next
>    octave.  The minor scale is the same, except it starts on the
>    second _la_ of the major scale.  Accidentals are mostly ignored,
>    to surprisingly good effect.  (The whole system is, as I
>    understand it, derived from the Lancashire fasola, a
>    four-syllable solfège system simplified from the old English
>    method of Playford and Morley.)  To learn to read the music, all

>    whether the next note is higher or lower by a little, or a lot.

Once most people are settled in, someone may open with a prayer,
depending on how formal a singing it is.  (I'm always surprised by the
number of non-religious people who love Sacred Harp singing, but
they're of course heartily welcomed; Sacred Harp singings are open to
anyone.)  Then the singing starts.  Someone will step into the open
middle of the square and call out the page number of the tune they
will lead.  People will find it, someone skilled at setting the pitch
for tunes will sing the starting pitches, and a wave of the leader's
hand and a confident bellow starts things off.

The first time through a tune, we sing the shapes; that is, instead of
the printed words, everyone sings the syllables of their part in a
glorious mishmash of fasola.  Then, we sing the words.  First of all,
you may notice that it's deafeningly loud, everyone singing at the top
of their lungs.  Next, you may notice that it's _exhilarating!_

After the tune ends, the leader will sit down, and the next person
will do the same.  Usually leading goes around the square, section by
section, person by person.  Even if you're brand new, you'll probably
be asked to come to the center and lead.  You _could_ demur, but I
wouldn't recommend it.  Usually you can come to the center with a more
experienced leader, and hear the sound from the best spot: the center
of the square.  (Leading isn't hard; watch how other people wave their
hands, and you'll see the pattern.)  If you thought it was
exhilarating before, this will lift your hair off!

It goes on and on, you get hoarse and tired, and you're happy to stop
for a break when that happens.  Break is over when a few people sit
down and someone starts leading a tune.  You'll go home exhausted and
with your throat sore, and probably want to do it again soon.

Here's one last tune, one of my favorites: William Billings' _David's
Lamentation_:

Doesn't that sound like a good way to spend some time?
