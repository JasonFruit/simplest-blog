I have no qualification to be teaching anyone, and I have no intent to
do so in this post.  It is written as an answer to a question I've
asked myself: "Is there a problem with how I and other Christians
approach politics?"  I have put it up here as a record of how I've
reasoned to myself on the topic, both from the Bible and in general,
and to invite others' criticism, as I'm sure I'm not the first person
among my circle of friends to ask that question.

### Difference Between Us and Biblical Israel ###

Abstract: Israel was really a nation under God, and we are not.

### The Bible Does Not Say to Keep Non-Christians From Sin ###

Abstract: As above.  However, see Jonah and the Ninevites.

### A Practical Objection: A Country is a Dangerous Beast ###

Abstract: It's dangerous to identify religiously with your country,
because it can as easily turn on you as do your religious bidding.

### Lesser of Two Evils ###

Abstract: Does God ever force one of His people into a choice between
two moral wrongs, or is that always the result and sign of their own
wrongdoing?  If He does not, why is that a good working definition of
politics?
