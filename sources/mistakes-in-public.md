Making Mistakes in Public
======================================================================

I don't like to make my mistakes publicly.  I was a classical musician
for years; there, it was almost possible to make my mistakes when
practicing in private, and avoid making them in front of colleagues
--- or worse yet, an audience.  There are, however, no practice rooms
in most of real life.  If you make a mistake, it's out there for
everyone to see, and you have to fix it in public, if you can.
