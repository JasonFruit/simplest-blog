The Constitution Might Just Help Us
======================================================================

I have friends of all political persuasions, and sometimes that's hard
to maintain.  There's a lot of argument about politics recently
&mdash; and by recently, I mean the last eight years and for the
foreseeable future; it especially focuses on what's being done at
the federal level.  

The tenth amendment to the United States Constitution reads:

> The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,
> nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States
> respectively, or to the people.
