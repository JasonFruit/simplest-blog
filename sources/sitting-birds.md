Sitting Birds and Curious Children
======================================================================

I'm always amazed at the curiosity of my children, and I've learned a
lot from them.  We have a cockatoo and a little parakeet, and I've
taken it for granted that they will perch to rest, sometimes on one
foot and sometimes on two, but leave it to a five-year-old to ask,
"Can birds sit down?"

Now, we raise chickens, and I know that they'll bed down in the grass,
which is kind of like sitting; at least, they're not on their
feet. (This is especially true of our meat birds, big fat Cornish
Cross who can do little _but_ lay in the grass.)  I didn't think,
though, that lighter, more athletic birds really sat or lay down
unless they were warming their eggs.  However, being a diligent father
and easily [nerd-sniped](http://xkcd.com/356/), I set out to find out
the details.

It turns out that owners of cockatoos and macaws, in particular,
sometimes give them a shelf in their cage to lay on â€” and they make
use of it!  One
[sun conure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_parakeet) owner said
that his bird loves to sleep on its back.  That reminded me that I
have in fact _seen_ our cockatoo lay down on my wife's chest when
she's petting/preening/obsessively picking at her.  So even a healthy
bird will lay down flat when it's comfortable enough.

Huh.  Now that's a thing that we know.
