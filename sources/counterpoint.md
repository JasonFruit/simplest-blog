Studying Counterpoint with Thomas Morley
======================================================================

In my school days, I never studied counterpoint formally; it wasn't
offered as a course, and the semester that I set out to take it as an
independent study, the professor came down with pneumonia.  I can't say,
based on my initial session with him, that I was disappointed not to
study with him — but that's a story for another time.

I have a better teacher now, though.  He's Thomas Morley, dead these
four hundred years, the composer of some of my favorite music from
Elizabethan England: the [Consort Lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2yqxneZJoU), the
[Canzonets](http://www1.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Canzonets_for_Two_Voices_(complete)_(Thomas_Morley)),
and any number of other delicious pieces.  Morley, near the end of his life, wrote
[A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke](http://imslp.org/wiki/A_Plain_and_Easy_Introduction_to_Practical_Music_(Morley,_Thomas)),
an instructional work in dialogue form, covering the rudiments of music,
sight-singing, counterpoint in two or more parts, and more general
composition.  I've been working through the section on counterpoint —
or as Morley calls it, _descanting_; he reserves the word counterpoint
for strict note-against-note writing — and it's a great way to learn.
Not only is Morley a fine composer, he's also a good writer and teacher.

Learning from this book makes me regret the demise of the instructional
dialogue in pedagogical literature.  Badly done, it's nothing but an annoyance;
one work on psalm-singing comes to mind, where the student's questions are
little more than topic headings, e.g. "_What be the several clefs?_",
but Morley is a master of the form.  His teacher, Master Gnorimus, is
erudite, witty, occasionally biting, but encouraging and helpful; the
student, Philomathes, is diligent, sometimes overconfident, and inclined
to be more critical of his teacher than of himself.  Their interplay
adds a personal element that engages me, and seeing Philomathes'
occasional embarrassment at making the same mistake in three different
places consoles me when I find I've done the same.

So much for the form of the work — what about the content?  I was
initially skeptical of Morley's rules, because  they seemed
over-simplified, especially when writing for more than two voices.  I
compared them with other works of the sixteenth century, and found my
concern justified: especially as regards treatment of the perfect fourth
in multi-part writing, Morley's rules did not accord with the practice
of Palestrina, Orlando di Lasso, or many others.  Next, however, I
compared Morley's approach with other English composers, and found them
much more closely in accord; it seems that between continental and
English part-writing there was a real difference in the handling of
dissonances between the upper voices, and that may account in part for
the richer sound of English music of that time.  Morley's own writing
follows his rules very closely, which may seem unsurprising, but I've
read enough theoretical writing from practicing composers to have found
otherwise.  I found a spot in one of the three-voice Canzonets that
broke his rules soundly — and then I found it mentioned in the text as
a youthful error, caught after it went to the printer.

Morley precedes Fux and his ilk; the species approach was unknown to
him, but he covers note-against-note writing (his use of the term
counterpoint); binding descant, which refers to a syncopated mode of
writing which alternates placing one note against a note of the
plainsong with placing a single note against two of the plainsong; and
free counterpoint.  He also briefly discusses other strict relations:
2-to-1, 3-to-1, 4-to-1, and more complex ones like 5-to-2, 7-to-3, and
so on, but that is a side discussion of the practice of others, and not,
in Morley's mind, practical or useful.  I'm inclined to accept his
opinion.

If I had a complaint about Morley's book as a self-teaching guide, it
would be the lack of material for practice.  Most of the examples are
against a single plainsong — a _tour de force_ of contrapuntal
inventiveness, to be sure, but not calculated to provide the student
with a rich source of plainsongs for the student to work examples over.
I have been drawing plainsongs for my exercises from 16th- and
17th-century psalm tunes, and it has mostly been satisfactory, barring a
tendency in the later psalm tunes to outline triads, which doesn't
really fit with the style Morley is aiming at.  Still, the challenge is
good, and the tunes are generally well-formed and interesting melodic
lines, which encourages me to try and write similarly good companions
for them.

I've been studying from Alec Harman's edition, which modernizes the
musical notation and a few terms, but the original is not a bit
intractable, if you take the trouble to become familiar with the quirks
of 16th-century music engraving.  The original is available for free at
[IMSLP](http://imslp.org/wiki/A_Plain_and_Easy_Introduction_to_Practical_Music_(Morley,_Thomas)),
and used copies of the Harman edition can be had for a few cents from
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Plain-Introduction-Practical-Norton-Library/dp/0393006824/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1427578563&sr=8-1&keywords=thomas+morley+alec+harman).
