Jesus on Hanukkah
======================================================================

I was fascinated the other night, when I was reading in John, to run
across this in John 10:22-23:

>   And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was
>   winter.  And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.

What got my attention was that I've read this passage dozens of times
and never noticed the "feast of the dedication."  I couldn't think of
a feast surrounding the dedication of either temple except for that of
Hanukkah, and looking it up, only Hanukkah took place in winter.  I
hadn't realized it was ever mentioned in the Bible, and it turns out I
was wrong.

Historically, Hanukkah was a celebration of a military and religious
victory, led by Judah Maccabee, over the ruling Greeks, culminating in
the rededication of the temple and restoration of worship there.
(There's no support for the story of one day's worth of oil burning
for eight days in the early documents.)  I think the nationalistic
nature of the celebration, especially in those days, sheds a bit of
light on what happens next (John 10:24):

>   Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long
>   dost thou make us to doubt?  If thou be the Christ, tell us
>   plainly.

Many Jews of that time expected the Messiah to be a Judah
Maccabee-like figure, a military and political leader who would lead
the Jewish people to freedom.  In the context of a nationalistic
feast, it makes sense that they would expect a man they thought might
be the Messiah to announce it publicly.

The enraging effect of Jesus' answer, which they perceived as
blasphemy — they tried to stone Him for it — must have been compounded
by its peaceful and extra-national nature (John 10:25-30):

>   Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works
>   that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.  But ye
>   believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.
>   My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: And I
>   give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither
>   shall any _man_ pluck them out of my hand.  My Father which gave
>   _them_ me, is greater than all, and no _man_ is able to pluck
>   _them_ out of my Father's hand.

>   I and _my_ Father are one.

So in the middle of a jingoistic celebration of a military victory,
Jesus is asked if He is the expected leader that will come to save the
Jewish people from oppression.  He responds with an answer that
promises salvation from a very different sort of oppression, for a
people that is His own, drawn from many nations, and then He claims
equality with God the Father.

It's no wonder the people he spoke to were angry; He was clearly not
one to be swayed by public opinion.  But His Messiahship was a far
greater blessing than that which people expected of Him!
