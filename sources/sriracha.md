My Recipe for Sriracha Sauce
======================================================================

Ingredients
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - 1 pound assorted hot peppers (I used serranos, habaneros,
   jalapeños, and cayenne peppers)
 - 2 heads garlic
 - 1 tbsp. salt
 - 1 c. white vinegar
 - 1 c. apple cider vinegar
 - 3½ tbsp. brown sugar
 
Instructions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Chop chiles and smash garlic.

Combine chiles, garlic, salt, and vinegars.  Simmer 1/2 hour or until
peppers are softened.

Add sugar and cool.  When cool, blend thoroughly.

Let sit out two days to ferment slightly.  Bottle and refrigerate.

Makes about 1 quart.

Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This recipe can be canned or frozen, but I hardly see the point.  It
won't last that long.
