About Me
======================================================================

I am a stay-at-home father and computer programmer who trained as a
classical violist and composer.  Being a Christian who is in favor of
liberty and in support of inexcusable ideas like the constitutional
originalism, nullification, and secession, I'm probably a white
supremacist domestic extremist or whatever they're calling people like
me this week.
