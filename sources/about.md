About Me
======================================================================

My name is Jason Fruit.  I have been and done a lot of things, roughly
in chronological order:

 - Classical violist and composer
 - Airplane fanatic
 - Folk musician
 - Computer programmer
 - Student of Latin
 - Stay-at-home father of three
 - Primitive Baptist
 - Hymnal compiler
 - Instrument maker

I'm sure the list has not ceased to grow.  As the header says, I'll
try anything once, as long as it's not too expensive, too dangerous,
or outright immoral.

Anything I do or am, I may write about.  You have been warned.
