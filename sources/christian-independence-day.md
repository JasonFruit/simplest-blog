A Christian Independence Day
======================================================================

Christianity in America is inseparable from patriotism.  Our churches
display American flags; our preachers speak of America's foundation on
Christian principles; Christians, more strongly than anyone, "support
our troops"; Christians discuss how we need to "take our country
back".  America, we are certain, has nurtured Christianity, has
supported the church like no other land on earth.  Christians are
proud and blessed to be Americans, even if the church and the United
States, like all friends, now and then fail to see eye-to-eye, have
their little disagreements; that's democracy for you, and democracy,
like patriotism, is surely a Christian principle.

It's a beautiful relationship, and it has been mutually beneficial —
the churches have become large and wealthy, and the American
government has gained valuable support from a potentially troublesome
constituency.  It's a pity that the closeness of the church to the
state is utterly unbiblical, which is to say, thoroughly unchristian.
Now, it is true that we should be subject to government, as Paul
writes in Romans 13:

>  <sup>1</sup>Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.  For
>  there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of
>  God… <sup>3</sup>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to
>  the evil.

We should not resist government authority (insofar as it is not a
"terror to good works"), but should we be a friend to it and the
nation that it represents simply because it is "ordained of God"?  God
ordained the Assyrians to a purpose, as is written in Isaiah 10:

>  <sup>5</sup>O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in
>  their hand is mine indignation.  <sup>6</sup>I will send him
>  against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath
>  will I give him a charge… <sup>12</sup> … when the Lord hath
>  performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will
>  punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the
>  glory of his high looks.

Clearly God's intent to use government for a purpose does not make it
a friend of His people.  As James 4:4 has it, "… know ye not that the
friendship of the world is enmity with God?  Whosoever therefore will
be a friend of the world is the enemy of God."  And on its part, the
United States, like all worldly bodies, is no friend of God or of His
people; Isaac Watts put it well when he wrote:

>  Are there no foes for me to face?  
>  Must I not stem the flood?  
>  Is this vile world a friend to grace,  
>  To help me on to God?

And we know that the things of God are foolishness to people in their
natural state; can we expect natural men, when aggregated in a
democracy, to spontaneously gain "the wisdom of God"?  No, even if the
United States were a pure democracy, that would not make it any less
inimical to God.

God's people, on the other hand, are called in Romans 12 to

>  <sup>2</sup> …be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed
>  by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good,
>  and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

Further, Christians are admonished in 1 John 2 to

>  <sup>15</sup>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the
>  world.  If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in
>  him.  <sup>16</sup>For all that is in the world… is not of the
>  Father, but is of the world.

Can Christians justify patriotism, in light of that?  Let alone
demanding it, does Christianity leave a place for any deep "love of
country"?  Can we hold that a body that requires pledges of
allegiance, oaths of office, asserts that it can compel not just our
bodies but our consciences, forcing us to act against them, a power
that in unnumbered ways usurps rights that are God's and God's alone —
can we hold that such a body is in any sense a friend to Christianity?
Can we hope to conform such a power to Christ, or will our
entanglement with it necessarily impel _us_ to be conformed to _it_?
Love for earthly nations has no place in Christian hearts.

How can Christians guard themselves against an inappropriate closeness
with worldly power?  I do not have the perfect answer, but I can think
of a few practices that that can help Christians raise such a mental
barrier.  First, when we pray for our country, which we always should,
we must make sure we are scrupulously honest in both our expressions
of gratitude and our petitions; we should not give thanks for benefits
we are not certain we have, and we should not ask for what we cannot
confidently count as real good.  If we assert in our prayers what is
neither Christian nor true, we will feel obligated to confirm those
prayers in our outward life.  Second, we should continually examine
ourselves to see if we are being conformed to the world in the way
that Paul warned against, instead of preserving our independence in
following Christ.

Finally, we should take warning from the experiences of the Israelites
in Egypt.  Joseph's usefulness to Pharaoh made his brethren welcome,
and doubtless their closeness with Egyptian power seemed like a great
benefit when Pharaoh said, "I will give you the good of the land of
Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land."  Surely Pharaoh was glad
to be enriched by the wisdom of Joseph, and Egypt was improved by the
industry of the Israelites.  Nonetheless, in the end, worldly power
showed itself the enemy of God's people: the children of Israel were
made slaves, and escaped Egyptian might in their departure into the
wilderness only through the powerful intervention of God.  If an
action or expectation of ours in relation to our country, then, would
seem naïve if projected onto Biblical Israel in their dealings with
the Egyptians and Pharaoh, we should suspect it of being naïve and
inappropriate.  For example, we should weigh our gratitude for how the
churches have prospered in America on the same scale we weigh the
Israelites' gratitude for their prosperity in Egypt.  Or, take a
headline in today's news which reads, "U.S. Supreme Court refuses to
hear family pharmacy's religious claim."  If we read it as, "Egyptian
Pharaoh refuses to hear Israelite midwives' religious objections," we
can hardly continue to expect to rely on the courts to ensure our
religious freedoms.

I believe it is urgent that Christians use this Independence Day to
declare our independence _from_ America and American patriotism, and
from all worldly nations, and that Christians should engage in an
exodus of their own, relying no longer on worldly strength, but on the
power of God alone.
